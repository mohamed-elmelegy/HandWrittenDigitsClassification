# Hand-Written Digits Classification

This is DSS(Decision Support Systems) course project. We used the [Digits Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html) from the scikit-learn libirary. We made some Visualization on the dataset with applying some of the most known algorithms on it.

## Applied Algorithms:
- K Nearest Neighbour(KNN).
- Logistic Regression.
- Decision Trees.

## Team Members:
- Mohamed Ashraf El-Melegy.
